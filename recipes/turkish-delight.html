                <li>260 millilitres water</li>
                <li>450 gram icing sugar</li>

                <li>orange food colouring, , optional</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon orange zest</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon pine nuts, , toasted and crushed</li>
                <h3>For dusting</h3>
                <li>¼ cup icing sugar</li>
                <li>⅛ cup cornstarch</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Lightly grease a medium loaf pan (8 ½ x 4 ½ x 2 ½) with the oil.</li>
                <li>Mix the gelatin, water and extract in a medium pot. Add the icing sugar and whisk vigorously.</li>
                <li>Cook the mixture over medium heat, whisking continuously until the sugar and gelatin has completely dissolved. </li>
                <li>Then bring the mixture to a boil. Once the mixture is bubbling, reduce the heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Avoid stirring the pot from this point.</li>
                <li>After about 20 minutes the mixture should become thick and syrupy. Remove the pot from heat and add a few drops of food colouring, stirring until the colour is even. </li>
                <li>Stir in the chopped nuts (and zest, if using), and then leave the mixture to cool for a couple of minutes. </li>
                <li>Pour the mixture into the loaf pan, cover with a dishcloth, and leave it to set at room temperature for 24 hours.
                </li>
                <li>Mix the cornstarch and icing sugar together well and sift to remove any lumps. Set this dusting mixture aside for later.
                </li>
                <li>Once the Turkish Delight has set, use a butter knife to score around the edges of the pan. Carefully pull the candy out of the pan with your hands and turn it out onto a flat surface that has been sprinkled with some of the cornstarch and icing sugar mixture.
                </li>
                <li>Use a sharp knife to cut the Turkish Delight into squares, wiping the blade as needed with a damp cloth.
                </li>
                <li>Roll your Turkish Delight blocks in the dusting mixture until well coated, then store in an airtight container. </li>
            </ol>
