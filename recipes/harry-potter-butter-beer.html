         <h1>Harry Potter's butter beer</h1>
           <img src="../imagess/hp-butterbeer.jpg"alt="butter beer from harry potter">
            <p>If you're not familiar with the Harry Potter books or films, you might be wondering, What is <strong>butterbeer?</strong> Is it really beer? Does it contain alcohol? </p>

            <p>Butterbeer is a (sort of) fictional beverage that the Harry Potter book characters drink when they visit “The Three Broomsticks” and “Hog’s Head Pub.” (Think cream soda meets butterscotch flavor with a whipped topping.) </p>
        <h1>ingredients</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>1 cup (8 oz) club soda or cream soda</li>
            <li>½ cup (4 oz) butterscotch syrup (ice cream topping) </li>
            <li>½ tablespoon butter </li>
            <li>heavy cream (optional)</li>
            <li>mugs</li>
            
         </ul>
         <h1>steps</h1>
          <ol>
            <li>Let your butter sit out until it is softened. </li>
            <li>Then pour the butterscotch syrup into a bowl. Butterscotch is what gives the butterbeer its main flavor.</li>
            <li>Add the softened butter. Some recipes call for butter extract, but we like the creamy goodness of the real thing.</li>
            <li>Then combine the syrup and butter.</li>
            <li>Pour cream soda into the mixture and stir. </li>
            <li>Set aside. </li>
            <li>In a separate mixing bowl, whip heavy whipping cream until it forms stiff peaks. It will take a hot minute by hand, but will go faster with a stand mixer. Don’t over whip or you’ll end up with fresh butter. </li>
            <li>Pour the cream soda and butterscotch mixture into two clear mugs, and top with a dollop or two of whipped cream. </li>
          </ol>
